# Using-NLP-and-machine-learning-techniques-to-identify-undervalued-football-players
This research underscores the relevance of the application of Natural Language Processing techniques in processing football related news in textual format to identify patterns and in
conjunction with player details and their respective values, can identify players that are considered undervalued. This objective is achieved through the derivation of the sentiments of
each news content or headline, whereby techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, coreference resolution, NER are employed to map extracted player names and perceived sentiments from the news article to their market values given other variables. Subsequently making predictions using machine learning algorithms; Random Forest Regressor, K Nearest Neighbour Regressor, Gradient Boost Regressor, SVM and Ada Boost Regressor. The results reveal that Random Forest Regressor and KNN can accurately predict market value of players by as much as 90% accuracy and the predictions in comparison to the actual value is an indication towards identifying players that are relatively undervalued or even overvalued. Nevertheless, it must be noted that these models are with respect to the English Football league and are yet to be tested on players from outside the English league given that the news data worked is primarily a collection from the English region. As an academdic study with license restrictions from the dataset source, Typewind Ltd, the dataset used in this study has not been made publicly available.
